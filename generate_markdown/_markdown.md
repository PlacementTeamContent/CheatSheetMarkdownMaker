### Options
1. 3 and 9
2. 4
3. 7
4. 6

### Answer:
3 and 9

### Explanation:
To find a 5-digit number X such that when you subtract the sum of its digits from X, the result is divisible by 9, Let's choose a 5-digit number, for example, 43,269 (A = 4, B = 3, C = 2, D = 6, E = 9). calculate the sum of the digits: 4 + 3 + 2 + 6 + 9 = 24. 43269-24=43245 So, the given number is divisible by 3 and 9.
