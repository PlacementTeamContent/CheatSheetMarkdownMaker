    "Question": "X is a 5 digit number when we subtract the sum of the digits form X, it becomes divisible by",
    "Option-1": "3 and 9",
    "Option-2": 4,
    "Option-3": 7,
    "Option-4": 6,
    "Answer": "3 and 9",
    "Explanation": "To find a 5-digit number X such that when you subtract the sum of its digits from X, the result is divisible by 9, Let's choose a 5-digit number, for example, 43,269 (A = 4, B = 3, C = 2, D = 6, E = 9). Calculate the sum of the digits: 4 + 3 + 2 + 6 + 9 = 24. 43269-24=43245 So, the given number is divisible by 3 and 9."
